# Cooking

Learning to cook one dish at a time. Now I understand what people meant when
they said that self cooked burned food also tastes good!


## Dishes

Here I will outline some of the basics, more like notes for myself.

### Chicken

#### My mom's style

This is what she could convey me over phone with the limited amount of spices
(and skill) I had. The notes are on how I did it.

- Marinate the chicken in oil, salt, turmeric (and chilly powder if you want).
    Leave it for at least 30 minutes (you can leave it for more time)
- Use a pressure cooker (saves time and effort) Heat oil in the cooker and then
- add bay leaves. After some time, add mustard
    and cumin seeds.
- Start chopping a few onions, more like 2 onions (or more) for 0.5 kg of
    chicken.
- Add them to the cooker and keep stirring intermittently while you do the next
    step.
- Start chopping garlic and ginger (the more the better I guess. Judge the
    quantity according to your taste or how much you have if you forgot to buy it last
    time you went for groceries). Ginger and garlic paste can also be used as a
    substitute (for hard work?). Add it when the onions have turned golden.
- Add any kind of Indian spices you can lay your hands on (or that's what I
    thought my mom was doing). I used coriander powder, "garam masala",
    chicken/meat masala, aamchur (ground mango) powder. Mix them well. Quantity
    wise I would go with half a table spoon for 0.5 kg chicken.
- Add the marinated chicken to the cooker and stir it well for the sauce to mix
    well with chicken.
- Start chopping potato (quantity depends on the taste, improves the taste and
- texture
    of the broth). I used 2 potatoes (medium sized) for 0.5 kg of chicken. Keep
    stirring the chicken intermediately while doing this. Add the potatoes and
    mix them well. Add salt and chilly to taste.
- Keep stirring for some time. Add water if you want more broth but be warned
    that chicken releases a lot of water too. Then cover the pressure cooker
    with its lid and leave it for three whistles.
- Leave the cooker off the heater to cool down on its own (at least till there 
    is no pressure inside). Then open the lid and stir it well.  If you want to
    thicken the broth, you can try mashing a few potatoes while it is still hot.

### Split pigeon peas (Dal)

- Wash the peas in water and add them to pressure cooker.
- Add salt, turmeric, chopped potatoes, a whole tomato into the cooker. Then add
    water (1:4 peas,water ratio).
- Close the lid and allow it for 3 whistles. Then get it off the stove. While
    waiting for the three whistles, start chopping onion and garlic.
- When you got the cooker off the stove, heat a skillet and add oil to it. When
    the oil gets heated, add mustard and cumin seeds. Allow them to cook and
    then add onions to them. When the onions turn golden, add the chopped garlic.
    Next add chopped chillies and then cook them for some time till the onions
    turn brown.
- Then open the cooker, take a cup or two (depending upon the space in the
    skillet) of cooked peas and add it to the skillet.
- Mix them well with the rest of spices. Mash a few potatoes if you want to
    thicken the broth. When it start to boil, pour everything in the skillet to
    the cooker and stir them well.
