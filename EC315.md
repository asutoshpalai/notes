## Exractring UPDATA.APP from update setup
- Downloaded the update setup
- Loaded it with PE explorer
- Extracted an _executable_ named UPDATEWIZARD\_130.exe from the Resource folder
- Loaded that with PE explorer
- Extracted a file named BIN\_250 from the Resource folder
- Renamed BIN\_250 to UPDATA.APP

## Extracting UPDATA.APP

### unknown\_file.1

**Sequence:** 00001100
**Size:** 38752 bytes (38K)
**Desc:** Qualcomm SBL1 image / Device Boot Loader
**Suggested Name:** dbl.mbn

Analysed with binwalk as per an online ref[Notes about Qualcomm Secure Boot and
Motorola High Assurance Boot
(hab)](http://vm1.duckdns.org/Public/Qualcomm-Secure-Boot/Qualcomm-Secure-Boot.htm).

It had 2 skip headers. The actual image was at offset 0x2000.

Loaded with IDA Pro using loader plugin from
[ralekdev/mbn\_ida\_loader](https://github.com/ralekdev/mbn_ida_loader/blob/master/mbn_ida_loader.py).
The plugin didn't work directly because as noted in the ref mentioned above,
with image type as `0x7D0B435A` it assumes that the image is at address
`0x2800`. But actually, it is just a forward pointer. There were 3 headers.
First 2 at 0, 0x800 respectively with image type as `0x7D0B435A`. The actual one
was at 0x2000. The last one's type field had `0xFFFFFFFF`.

Applied the following patch to make it work for this file:
```patch

### unknown\_file.2

**Sequence:** 00001300
**Size:** 672072 bytes (657K)
**Desc:** OS Boot Loader
**Suggested Name:** osbl.mbn

From the online ref about Secure Bootloader and HBA, one could guess that this
file was High Assurance Boot (hab) file. The file structure matched the one
given online, but the type `0x0000000b` as no where to be found. All the online
refs pointed it to be `0x00000005`.

It could be loaded into IDA Pro with the same loader file mentioned above.

But later I found that I was mistaken in assuming it to be aboot.mdn (not that I
know what aboot is ;) ). As I learned from an [online form](For http://forum.gsmhosting.com/vbb/f804/huawei-modem-universal-flasher-1495518/index23.html#post9851968) it is actually osbl.mbm

```
$ strings unknown_file.2 | grep target
E:\baiyunting\11.102.99.60.00\core\boot\amssboot\target\qsc6695\src\boot_shared_progressive_boot_block.c

### unknown\_file.3

**Sequence:** 00000800
**Size:** 19005440 bytes (19M)
**Desc:** Qualcomm's operating system
**Suggested Name:** amss.mbn

Upon further research it turned out to be `amss.mbn`. (Searched strings on
google and found https://pastebin.com/NcGy8Fr7)

```
  $ strings unknown_file.2 | grep target
  E:\baiyunting\11.102.99.60.00\core\boot\amssboot\target\qsc6695\src\boot_shared_progressive_boot_block.c

AMSS stands for Advanced Mobile Subscriber Software (Qualcomm's operating
system). Ref: [Mobile Devices: Tools and
Technologies](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=lky3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=full+form+amss+firmware&source=bl&ots=LOj8slD2l1&sig=FwadyTImv2zKOSRFUA9yI6DkmSg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje7-mP_e3VAhUKso8KHVrrDTgQ6AEIVjAI#v=onepage&q=full%20form%20amss%20firmware&f=false)

### unknown\_file.4

**Sequence:** 00000900
**Size:** 284672 bytes (278K)
**Desc:** EFS2 File system
**Suggested Name:** efs2.mbn

Upon analysis of amss.mbn as ARM ELF file, the magic bytes for this, `87 67 85
34 59 77 34 92` (0x34856787, 0x92347759) was found in a function which was being
called (after a series of intermediate functions) from a function which referred
to the string "EFS2". So, I guess this is our best bet.

## USB connection attempt:

- Pluging in, `lsusb` read:

  `Bus 003 Device 014: ID 12d1:1f01 Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. E353/E3131 (Mass storage mode)`

- Installed `usb_modeswitch`. It added the necessary udev rules.

  The switched interface looked to be:
  `Bus 003 Device 011: ID 12d1:14db Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. E353/E3131` 

- This is usb ethernet mode.

- Seems like not switching to serial mode and switching to ethernet mode is a
  known issue.

- Was able to switch to serial mode, thanks to discussion an online discussion
  for [Huawei E353](http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/bb/viewtopic.php?p=8651#p8651)

  - Disabled udev rule for `12d1` (Generic Huawei device).

  - Executed command 

    sudo usb_modeswitch -v 0x12d1 -p 0x1f01 -M "55534243123456780000000000000011060000000000000000000000000000"

- Now it detects two `ttyUSB` devices:

  ```
  --- Available ports:
  ---  1: /dev/ttyUSB0         HUAWEI Mobile
  ---  2: /dev/ttyUSB1         HUAWEI Mobile
  ```
- Was able to send AT commands using `/dev/ttyUSB0`: `sudo socat -
  /dev/ttyUSB0`. Tried some ref commands from
  [https://routerunlock.com/useful-at-commands-for-huawei-modem/](https://routerunlock.com/useful-at-commands-for-huawei-modem/)
  and [Hacking the Huawei
  E589](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=44389917&postcount=2)

- Found an offical doc, [HUAWEI ME906s LTE Module AT Command Interface Specification-%28V100R001_01%2C English%29.pdf](http://download-c.huawei.com/download/downloadCenter?downloadId=51047&version=120450&siteCode)

- Switched `/dev/ttyUSB0` to QCDM with `AT$QCDMG` AT command. Later found that
  /dev/ttyUSB1 was in 

- Tested QCDM with qcdm.pl obtained from [huawei.git by Dobrica Pavlinusic](http://git.rot13.org/?p=huawei.git;a=summary)

- Sending diag commands for peek returns packets starting with 0x13
  (`DIAG_BAD_CMD_F`).
  Found a call to `diagpkt_err_rsp` with 0x13 at `0x08176846`, `0x0812ED20`, `0812EC8E`, `0812EBFE`, `0812EB42`, `0812E91A`, `0809E166`, `0809E14C`, `0809DE94`, `0809DE76`


## Analysis of amss.mbn

- Loaded into IDA as an ARM ELF file.
- Tried Snowman for decompling, didn't work as it doesn't support THUMB
  instruction set.
- Looked for AT command strings and tried to reverse the functions.
- Searched for the magic string for the 5th unknown file,
  `87 67 85 34 59 77 34 92`. Got two hits at 

    - 0x0055C054  DCD 0x34856787
    - 0x00733AF4  DCD 0x34856787

  Both the locations had the second half of the magic bits.

  At the hit at 0x0055C054 the magic bits were being assigned to something. The
  trail of `xrefs from` went down a dead end.

  The hit at 0x00733AF4 was being referred by function (present just above),
  beginning at 0x00733A5C. It was verifying the magic bytes from a buffer.
  Following the trail of `xref from` lead me to a function at 0x00364420 which
  had the reference to the string "EFS2".  Interesting. So, I guess that the last
  unknown file is a EFS2 file system.

- [SMD (Shared Memory Device)](https://osmocom.org/projects/quectel-modems/wiki/Qualcomm_Linux_SMD)

- OSA is a cooperative multitasking real-time operating system (RTOS) for Microchip PIC-controllers.

- searching for `websdk` gave interesting results 
- same goes for `ipwebs`
  A lot of functions can be identified using the log messages.
- A memory map was found resembling the found at page 66 of [Mobile Data modem user guide](https://electronix.ru/forum/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=102723)
- Got peek into qualcomm source code files for the first time at [huawei.git by Dobrica Pavlinusic](http://git.rot13.org/?p=huawei.git;a=summary) inside the AMSS folder.
