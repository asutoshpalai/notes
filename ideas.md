  - The actual OS runs on a mobile phone. Either full OS is replaced with this
    OS or an APP inside which this OS runs.
  - When plugged as USB device, this exposes a bootable drive which boots a very
    light weight OS (maybe some lightweight Linux distro).
  - The booted OS exposes all the devices (video, graphics card, CPU, RAM, other

    machine) to our OS (on the mobile device).
  - The mobile OS uses the host display and input device and resumes operation.
