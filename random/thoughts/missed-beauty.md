# Somethings come to stay with us forever

Ever had that moment where you saw something remarkably beautiful, and you fell
in love with it. Maybe it was a line in a song, an interaction with a stranger
or some art that spoke to you. But, then it went away, and despite all your
efforts, you were not able to find it. However, all was not lost, what it meant,
the ideas it introduced or the worlds it opened stayed with you for a long time,
maybe forever, guiding and inspiring you. In its search, you might find
something inferior, something superior or perhaps even something more
impressive, but that lost one spoke to you.
