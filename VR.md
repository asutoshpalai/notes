# VR (Oculus Quest 2)

## Development

### Game Engines

Unity and Unreal Engine are mentioned in the official documentations. Although
both are almost equivalent in power and performance, Unity is heavily
recommended for beginners.

Gotdot also supports VR.

## Jail-breaking

- Non available as of now.
- Some people have been able to reach Android setting but apparently that's
being actively blocked by some background process.
