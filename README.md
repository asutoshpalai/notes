# Notes

Collection of notes on some random things I tinker with.

## Contents

- [log.md](log.md) Mostly I will be putting interesting links I come across.

- [EC315.md](EC315.md) Attempt to extract the firmware and reverse it to gain some internal understanding. My secret desire was to gain some code execution on the device after which I can mod the system as per my needs. I had a TATA Photon Huawei EC315 3G USB modem with Wi-Fi capabilities.

- [EC315_research.md](EC315_research.md) Links to online resources I explored while working on EC315 modem.

- [AC3633_v2.md](AC3633_v2.md) Similar aim as of EC315. I had a MTS Wi-Fi USB dongle.

- [android_wlan.md](android_wlan.md) Attempt at understanding the working of Wi-Fi module in my Moto G5 Plus.

- [ideas.md](ideas.md) Some of the randoms ideads I had. (They are all available
  in public domain, will add a licence in some time. I would prefer if you just
  give me some credits.)

- [rfid_reader.md](rfid_reader.md) Notes on analysis of a cheap RFID device I
got off Ebay and it's protocol.

- [Tenda_N301.md](Tenda_N301.md) Basic analysis of Tendra N301 router firmware.
