# Notes

Collection of notes on some random things I tinker with.

## Contents

- [EC315.md](EC315.md) Attempt to extract the firmware and reverse it to gain some internal understanding. My secret desire was to gain some code execution on the device after which I can mod the system as per my needs. I had a TATA Photon Huawei EC315 3G USB modem with Wi-Fi capabilities.

- [EC315_research.md](EC315_research.md) Links to online resources I explored while working on EC315 modem.

- [AC3633_v2.md](AC3633_v2.md) Similar aim as of EC315. I had a MTS Wi-Fi USB dongle.

- [android_wlan.md](android_wlan.md) Attempt at understanding the working of Wi-Fi module in my Moto G5 Plus.
